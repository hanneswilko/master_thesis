The scheme is linked to voluntary agreements to reduce emissions under the pre-existing CO2 Law. Companies covered by voluntary agreements can convert these agreements into legally binding CO2 emissions targets, allowing them to participate in emissions trading and be exempted from the CO2 tax. Emission allowances are allocated to companies for free and from 2008, emission allowances equivalent to the amount of CO2 emitted have to be surrendered annually. Additional allowances can be sold. Where non-compliance occurs (i.e. where the adequate number of allowances is not surrendered) the CO2 tax is paid retroactively for each tonne of CO2 emitted since the exemption was granted.",In force,CHE,Switzerland,"Buildings,Industry,Power","Carbon pricing instruments,Regulations",Emission Trading System (ETS),https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-13369.html

Buildings which meet the Minergie standards can then display the Minergie label. The SIA building code sets an overall limit on energy use for heating, hot water, ventilation and air-conditioning of 16 kWh /m2 for new and 24 KWh/m2 for renovated buildings. The Minergie Label is granted for buildings 20% below the acutal standard.

The Fund also supports the implementation of innovative environmental capital projects providing grants, loans and loan guarantees at competitive interest rates to municipalities and their partners. In addition, CAD 750,000 annually is allocated to the Green Municipal Capacity Building Program, which supports the Partners for Climate Protection program. In 2012, Green Municipal Fund eligibility was refined to target initiatives that aim to achieve significant environmental impacts and have the potential to be replicated in other communities.In 2023, the Community Efficiency Financing initiative was set up to help Canadian municipalities create, implement, and scale up home-energy upgrade financing programs for residential properties. With a $300 million investment, it supports various financing models like Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE), utility on-bill financing, and third-party lending partnerships. ",In force,CAN,Canada,Buildings,"Government spending for energy-efficient buildings,Incentives and investments",Existing buildings,http://fcm.ca/home/programs/green-municipal-fund.htm
